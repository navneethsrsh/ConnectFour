# Connect Four
## Intro
As a beginner approaaching close to 3 months coding with python, I finally took the plunge and begain my first project.
The idea for the project came tanks to a course I took on pirple.com.
## Project
The project is to code the game Connect Four which can be played on the command line terminal.
## How to Play
The rules to the game can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utXzIFEVPjA&t=207s)
## Solutions
There are two solutions available for this project.
Solution 1 is a *modular approach* because i hadn't yet learnt classes in python. The code basically usees a host of functions to get the job done.

Solution 2 is an *object-oriented* approach which was just much more interesting from a learning purposes.
